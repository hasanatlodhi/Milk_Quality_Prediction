# Milk_Quality_Prediction

The quality of milk is of utmost importance in the dairy industry as it directly affects consumer health and satisfaction. Accurate and timely prediction of milk quality can assist dairy farmers, processors, and regulators in maintaining high standards, ensuring product safety, and optimizing production processes.

In this project, we explore the application of machine learning techniques to predict the quality of milk. The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science competitions and datasets. The dataset contains various features related to such as pH, Taste, Odor, Fat etc.
